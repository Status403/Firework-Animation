# Firework-Animation
This is my edition of Tech with Tim's Firework Animation Video. 
So i changed a bit and but the most important thing is that i made
a class Main which has an inner class Launcher which has an inner class Firework 
which has an inner class Projectile which is the parent of the class SubProjectile 
which is aswell the inner class of Firework. Additionally i added a function which creates the launcher, 
the function is called in the init method of the Main class. If the "Projectile" disappears it creates 
a SubProjectile object in the outer Firework class, which behaves just like the 
Projectile object (thats why its inherated from Projectile) except it doesnt create new SubProjectiles
Thats everything i have to say about my edit.
