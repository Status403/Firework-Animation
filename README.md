# Firework-Animation
This is my edition of Tech with Tim's Firework Animation Video. 
So i changed a bit and but the most important thing is that i made
a class Main which has an inner class Launcher which has an inner class Firework 
which has an inner class Projectile. Additionally i added a function which creates the launcher, 
the function is called in the init method of the Main class. Thats everything i have to say about my edit.
